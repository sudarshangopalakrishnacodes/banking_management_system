# BANKING SYSTEM â€” Core Java Console Application

This is a **console-based Banking System** developed using **Core Java**. It demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **classes**, **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **method abstraction**.

The application simulates basic banking operations like creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking balances â€” all from the command line.
